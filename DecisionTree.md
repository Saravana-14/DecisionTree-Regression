Tree-based ML Algorithm[Decision Tree works like a flowchart, splitting data into branches based on conditions to make predictions.]
Easy to Understand & Interpret[It visualizes decision rules clearly, making the model highly interpretable compared to other ML algorithms.]
Handles Both Types of Data[Decision Trees can be used for classification (categorical output) and regression (numerical output).]
No Need for Feature Scaling[Unlike SVM or KNN, Decision Trees do not require normalization or standardization of data.]
Prone to Overfitting[If the tree becomes too deep, it may overfit. Techniques like pruning help improve generalization.]
